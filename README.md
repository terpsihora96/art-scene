# RG28-art-scene

The very first attempt to fusion art and computer science by combining sophisticated algorithms with playful visual representation moderated by my eyeballs and my fresh openGL skills.
The animation is generated by perverted idea of particle swarm optimization algorithm (PSO) and additional visual effects - fog, light, textures, shapes. The presented output is just one out of many tried, failed, lost; others could be seen [here](https://github.com/MATF-RG19/RG28-art-scene/tree/master/screenshots).

## Tech

Program is written in:
C++

To compile and run it:

```
git clone https://github.com/MATF-RG19/RG28-art-scene.git
cd RG28-art-scene
make && make run
```

### Controls

<table>
  <tr>
    <th colspan="2">Global</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Exit</td><td>Esc</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Param 1 (torus)</td><td>t or T</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Param 2 (wire cube)</td><td>j or J</td>
  </tr>
</table>

After playing with animation:

```
make clean
```

### Librairies

OpenGL, glut, image.h

### Code structure

All of the libraries, headers are in ./headers, all of the source files are in ./sources.
In ./textures are bmp images of used textures.
In ./screenshots are all of the previous recorded attemps (also very interesting to look at).
